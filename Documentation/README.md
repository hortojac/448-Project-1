# Playing the Game

The interactive GUI allows for button pressing and clicking on <abbr title="any Tkinter element that builds the interface">**widgets**</abbr> to perform actions. You can enter in your names, and click on buttons to both place your ships and attack your enemy's board. 

# The Code

For our Battleship game, we used `Python` v3.10.0 with the imported libraries of 
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) to implement an interactive GUI.
- [functools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html) to implement partial functions for some Tkinter buttons.
- [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) to more easily implement double for loops
- [PIL/Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for image integration (need to install through the terminal)

GUI programming is event-based programming, and this reflects as such in the code: instead of having linear code that executes `line 1`, `line 2`, `line 3`, etc. in order, code runs when its event is triggered. 

For example, in the following code block, even though `setup_frame3` is defined _before_ the `myButton1`, it'll only run _after_ the myButton1 is _clicked_ by the user. The `command = partial(setup_frame3, 1)` defines the function call when the button is clicked. 

```python
def setup_frame3(number_of_ships):
    ship_count(number_of_ships) # passes num_ships into frames 4,5 to set up ship placement 
    show_frame(frame3)

myButton1 = Button(frame2, 
    text="1 ship",
    font=("Arial",20, BOLD), 
    padx=25, pady=25, 
    command=partial(setup_frame3, 1)
    ).place(
      relx=.5, rely=.3,
      anchor= CENTER)
```

### Module List
- start.py - handles GUI
- player.py - tracks player information (names, ships)
- ship.py - tracks ship information (positions, life counter)
- place_board.py - handles ship placement 


## start.py
This handles the main sequence of scenes/frames/screens and all of the GUI. 

<details open>
<summary>Frame List</summary>

- **Frame 1:** The start screen
- **Frame 2:** Select the number of ships to play with
- **Frame 3:** Enter in Player Names
- **Frame 4:** Player 1 Ship Setup
- **Frame 5:** Player 2 Ship Setup
- **Frame 6:** Asks if Player 1 is ready
- **Frame 7:** Player 1 attack screen
- **Frame 8:** Asks if Player 2 is ready
- **Frame 9:** Player 2 Attack screen
- **Frame 10:** Win Screen

> Note: The attack phase loops through frames 6-9.

<summary>Button Indexing</summary>

We store button locations not as x/y coordinates, but as a _single_ integer, where 
- `index % 10` is the column number (A-J on an official Battleship board) 
- `ceil(index / 10)` is the row number (1-10 on an official Battleship board)

For example:

## ship.py

Member Variables:
- `positions` - the location(s) of each ship
- `lives` - how many lives a ship has. At the start of the game, this is initalized based on the ship type (e.g. A has 1, B has 2, etc.) and decreases as players land hits. 

Member functions: 
- `to_string()` - prints ship information 

## player.py

Member Variables: 
- `name` - the player name; retrieved during frame 3, used in labels and popups throughout gameplay
- `my_board` - displays the player's board with ships visible
- `enemy_board` - displays the enemy's board with no ships visible UNLESS the player has landed hits/sinks
- `ships` - a dictionary of the player's ships. See code for structure. 

Member functions: 
- `set_ships(num_ships)` - updates `player.ships` depending on the number of ships chosen by the player
- `to_string()` - prints player information except boards
